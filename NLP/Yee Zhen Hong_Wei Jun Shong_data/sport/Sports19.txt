Zii Jia prepared to fight through gruelling run
AS FAR as Lee Zii Jia is concerned, it is the survival of the fittest in the Malaysian Open with the majority of the players competing in their third tournament in four weeks.

The gruelling run started with the back-to-back Indonesia Masters (June 7-12) and Indonesian Open (June 14-19) while the home tournament began at the Axiata Arena on Tuesday after a week’s break.

A spate of withdrawals in the ongoing meet is already an indication of the physical strain and Zii Jia, who had been playing with a hip injury, managed to survive the first round unscathed after beating Nhat Nguyen of Ireland 21-15, 21-11 in 47 minutes. “Most of the players who are playing in this tournament are tired and it (hip injury) is not an excuse.

“This tournament is about who can withstand the physical test until the end,” said the world No. 5.

“I still need to adjust to the windy condition in the stadium but it is a boost to play in front of the home crowd. It was like a normal match for me today (yesterday).”

Zii Jia’s second round opponent Shesar Hiren of Indonesia went through to the second round after Rasmus Gemke of Denmark retired injured while trailing 9-11 in the second game. Gemke had won the first game 21-15.

Zii Jia believes he has come a long way since losing in the first round of the Malaysian Open held in 2019. “I am more composed and mature in handling pressure now and also have the confidence to play in front of the big crowd,” said Zii Jia.
“I will come prepared as it is going to be a tough game.”

Zii Jia has the advantage over Shesar as the Malaysian has won four of the seven matches they have played so far.

Second seed Kento Momota also earned a free ride after his opponent Kantaphon Wancharoen withdrew while qualifier P. Kashyap outplayed Heo Kwang-hee of South Korea 21-12, 21-17.

In the second round today, Momota will meet Angus Ng Ka Long of Hong Kong while top seed Viktor Axelsen will face another Hong Kong shuttler Lee Cheuk Yiu.
