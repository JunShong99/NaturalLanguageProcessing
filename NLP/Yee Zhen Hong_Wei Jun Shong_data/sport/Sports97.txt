Malaysian cagers take bronze, thanks to Thais
THE Malaysian women's basketball team defeated the Philippines 96-93 yesterday to win the Sea Games bronze medal in Hanoi.

Defeat against Vietnam on Saturday had ended Malaysia's gold medal hopes. It had also ensured that the Philippines took home the gold for the second straight Games.

But despite the setback, the Malaysian women went into the match with a point to prove.

And they certainly did so as, despite trailing 25-28 in the first quarter, they turned it around to lead 58-54 at halftime and 77-71 after the third quarter.

The Filipinas did, however, bounced back to lead 93-88 with two minutes left before Malaysia rallied with Chong Yin Yin hitting a game-winning three-pointer with 17 seconds left on the clock as the team held for the win.


Yin Yin and Yap Fook Yee scored 25 points apiece, while Pang Hui Pin produced a captain's performance with 21 points and 10 rebounds.

It was a sweet victory for Malaysia.

And they certainly had Thailand to thank. The Thais dashed Vietnam's hopes with a thrilling 78-75 win yesterday.

Indonesia finished second after an 87-53 win over Singapore.

National assistant coach Thoh Chai Ling praised the team for their efforts.

"It was a really good team performance, and the players never gave up against the Philippines," said Chai Ling.

"I'm really impressed with their attitude today, and it's really good for them to finish the Games on a high."

In the men's competition, Indonesia scored an upset as they toppled the Philippines 85-81 for the gold medal.

The Philippines, featuring a full professional lineup, were the red-hot favourites to extend their dominance since 1991.

But they were left shell-shocked as a spirited Indonesia took the fight to them to nail their first-ever basketball gold and end the Filipinos' 31-year reign in the competition.
