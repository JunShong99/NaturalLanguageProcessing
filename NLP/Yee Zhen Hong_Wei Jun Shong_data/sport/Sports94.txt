Waiting game at the games
THE athletics squad hit their "safe" five-gold target with relative ease in Hanoi. However, Malaysian Athletics Federation (MAF) president Datuk S. M. Muthu admitted his charges should have won more.


Most of the big names did not disappoint. However, the emergence of younger athletes such as Eizlan Dahalan and Arsyad Saad bodes well for the future.

The team recorded three national records in the men's 4x100m relay, women's discus and women's heptathlon.

But MAF must do more as winning only five of a possible 47 gold is poor if we consider Malaysia's past achievements.

ARCHERY

Target: 2 gold (recurve), 2 gold (compound)

Achievement: 2-2-5

Grade: C (recurve); A (compound)

JUWAIDI Mazuki and Fatin Nurfatehah Mat Salleh were those who shone in the compound disciplines with titles.

However, the recurve squad were a huge disappointment with no gold to show.

Syaqiera Mashayikh, however, impressed on her Sea Games debut and could play a bigger role in the recurve squad in the future.

BADMINTON

Target: 1 gold

Achievement: 1-2-1

Grade: A

THE BA of Malaysia (BAM) were among the national bodies that chose to send a full squad of youngsters to Hanoi for exposure rather than depending on their world-class shuttlers.

That, however, did not stop them from achieving their one gold target in Hanoi and even made the mixed doubles final an all-Malaysian affair. The men's squad also showed their prowess by beating Singapore in the men's team semi-final.

Other associations should emulate BAM by making the Sea Games a development tournament for their rising stars.

BASKETBALL

Target: 0-1-2

Achievement: 0-0-1

Grade: B

EVEN with the eye-watering RM2 million reward promised by the Malaysian Basketball Association (MABA), their teams did not have the best outing in Hanoi, securing only one bronze through the women's 5x5 event.

MABA had targeted two more medals from both the men's and women's 3x3 events, but both returned empty-handed. It may be a slow climb, but the national body have set a long term goal of securing gold in the next six years.

BODYBUILDING

Target:1-2-3

Achievement: 1-3-4

Grade: A

BODYBUILDING is not often part of the Sea Games, which is a shame as the sport is popular in this region.

National bodybuilders jumped at the chance to compete in Hanoi, and they certainly impressed the judges.

Four-time world champion Syarul Azman Mahen Abdullah was the star, but his road to the men's athletic physique title was rocky as he had tested positive for Covid-19 before his event.

BOWLING

Target: None

Achievement: 0-2-1

Grade: B+

SIMILAR to badminton, the Malaysia Tenpin Bowling Congress also sent a young squad to Hanoi, with all 10 bowlers having never competed in the Sea Games. The squad got off to a slow start in the men's and women's singles events but found their rhythm in the doubles and team categories.

BOXING

Target: 1-1-2

Achievement: 0-0-3

Grade: C

MALAYSIA have not won a gold in boxing in games hosted outside of Kuala Lumpur since the 2009 Naypyidaw edition. Judging from the squad's performance in Hanoi, it does not look like that will happen anytime soon.

The semi-finals were as far as the national boxers could advance in Hanoi.

Thailand and the Philippines are world-beaters in the sport, and Malaysia need to ramp up their development efforts to stand a chance against them.

CANOE, KAYAKING & ROWING

Target: 0-1-0 (canoe-kayak), 0-0-1 (rowing)

Achievement: 0-0-0 (canoe-kayak). 0-0-0 (rowing)

Grade: D

Only one medal was targeted from both the canoe-kayak and rowing disciplines, but even that was unachievable in Hanoi.

The relevant sporting authorities should refine their development efforts as these are Olympic sports.

CHESS

Target: 0-1-1

Achievement: 0-0-2

Grade: C

Despite achieving a couple of podium finishes, it still wasn't the best of outings for the chess squad, with Yeoh Li Tian failing to retain his men's rapid title. Malaysia, however, won one bronze through Sim Jia Ru in the women's rapid event and another in the women's team blitz.

CUE SPORTS

Target: 1-1-0

Achievement: 1-1-1

Grade: A

WITH no development and a proper training centre, Malaysian snooker defied the odds by producing a six-red gold medallist in Lim Kok Leong. He was denied a second title by James Wattana in the snooker singles event. For the record, the national cueists have never failed to deliver medals in recent Sea Games. They have also won Asian Games and world amateur titles in the past.

CYCLING

Target: 1 gold (road), 1 medal (mountain biking)

Achievement: 2-3-3

Grade: A

IT was a positive outing for the road and mountain biking (MTB) squads at the Hanoi Sea Games.

The MTB squad created history by winning the mixed team event — their first title in the Sea Games.

The road events were harder to predict, and although the men's team missed out on a medal in the criterium, they bounced back strong to take gold in the road race.

The women's double silver from the individual and team categories in the road race were also a commendable achievement.

DANCESPORT

Target: 1 gold

Achievement: 0-0-1

Grade: C

BREAKING, in which Malaysia won a title in 2019 (Manila), was excluded this time from the Games despite its inclusion in the 2024 Paris Games.

To their credit, the Malaysia Dancesport Federation did not shy away and still set a one-gold target.

Though they were not able to achieve it, the national dancers, who competed under category B (self-funded), can still be proud of their bronze effort through Leonard Hoh-Mu Ning Huan (slow foxtrot).

DUATHLON

Target: None

Achievement: 0-1-0

Grade: B

Malaysia did not score any medals in the sport at the 2019 Manila Games but secured one silver this time through Tahira Najmunisaa Zaid.

The mother-of-four's silver is certainly an inspiring feat and will spur more athletes to follow in her footsteps and pursue the sport at elite level.

Due to their accessibility, duathlon and triathlon are popular among amateur athletes, with many juggling day jobs while competing at a high level.

DIVING

Target: 8 gold

Achievement: 8-3-1

Grade: A+

The diving squad entered the competition as outright favourites, and they certainly did not disappoint.

As expected, the national senior divers had no difficulty helping Malaysia achieve a clean sweep in the sport.

However, Malaysia Swimming (MS) should have sent a full squad of youngsters to the Sea Games for exposure, considering that the seniors are world-class divers.

ESPORTS

Target: 1-0-4

Achievement: 0-0-3

Grade: C

Despite missing out on a gold medal, the Malaysian camp can still take heart from their performance in Hanoi.

As Malaysia continue to stamp their mark on the international stage, it will be interesting to see if Esports will be one of the main medal contributors in future editions.

FENCING

Target: 0-1-2

Achievement: 0-1-3

Grade: C+

There were no surprises from the fencing squad as they marginally surpassed their target.

Olympian Yu Peng Kean, who had retired in 2017, attempted a comeback, but got soundly beaten in his matches. The sabre specialist lamented a lack of sparring partners in Malaysia.

The lack of senior sabre fencers is something the national body may want to look at and improve for the future.

FOOTBALL & FUTSAL

Target: 0-0-1 (football), futsal (none)

Achievement: 0-0-1

Grade: C

HANOI was not a priority for Brad Maloney's side as the aim was to have his players get game-time ahead of next month's Under-23 Asia Cup. He did not include overage players for the tournament.

The team were impressive in the group stage but were unlucky to lose to Vietnam (semi-finals) and Indonesia (bronze playoff). The men's futsal team were a disgrace as they failed to win a match, while the women's squad took bronze.

GOLF

Target: 0-1-1

Achievement: 2-1-1

Grade: A+

GOLF is unpredictable, and not many people would have expected Malaysia to achieve a double gold feat in the men's event this time.

Ervin Chang was the man of the moment as he carried his form from his individual win, the first for Malaysia in the Sea Games, to the team event. The last time Malaysia won the men's team gold was in 2001.

GYMNASTICS

Target: 2 gold (rhythmic) 2 gold (artistic)

Achievement: 4-2-2

Grade: A

MALAYSIA bagged nine gold in gymnastics in 2019 but were forced to lower their target in Hanoi due to the omission of a few events.

The squad, however, did not disappoint and delivered as expected in both the artistic and rhythmic disciplines.

Rachel Yeoh, who secured two individual titles, was named the national contingent's most outstanding female athlete.

KARATE

Target: 3 gold

Achievement: 4-0-6

Grade: A+

THE karate squad have rarely disappointed and have been among the most consistent contributors to the nation's haul at the Sea Games over the past decade.

They delivered another four gold this time, which allowed the contingent to hit their 36-gold target in Hanoi. The emergence of new faces amongst the medallists, such as C. Shahmalarani and H. Sureeya Sankar, shows the future is good for karate.

Winning the men's team gold, which they had not won in 29 years, also shows they have depth.

KICKBOXING

Target: 0-0-1

Achievement: 0-0-5

Grade: B

AS the host nation decided to drop several weight categories from Muay Thai, world champion Rifdean Masdor was forced to try his luck in kickboxing and was still able to finish on the podium.

JUDO

Target: 0-1-2

Achievement: 0-0-2

Grade: D

JUDO fell slightly short of their target but will be encouraged with the emergence of Amir Daniel Abdul Majeed, who turns 18 in October.

Amir, the 2019 Junior Asia Cup medallist, won the bronze in the men's combat Under-73kg.Despite it being an Olympic sport, judo is not popular in the country and has not produced a Sea Games champion.

JIU-JITSU

Target: 0-2-4

Achievement: 0-1-1

Grade: C

THE sport is new in the Sea Games, having made its debut in 2019.With experience from 2019 to build on, the national squad set a target of two silver and four bronze but fell short in Vietnam.

Their one silver and one bronze haul equal their performance in Manila. It is not a bad result considering their athletes were classified as category B, and all hold full-time jobs.

KURASH

Target: 0-0-2

Achievement: 0-0-3

Grade: B

After clinching a solitary silver in 2019, the kurash squad did well to place more exponents on the podium in Hanoi this time, albeit in the bronze medal position.

The achievements will definitely attract more Malaysians to take up the sport.

MUAY THAI

Target: None

Achievement: 1-1-0

Grade: A

MALAYSIAN Muay Thai had been delivering titles in the last few editions, and they continued to do so in Hanoi.

Youngster Ahmad Nor Iman Aliff Rakib was the star when he won the men's under-54kg class.

Ahmad, who is the son of former national boxer Rakib Ahmad, is a world junior champion and has the potential to improve.

PENCAK SILAT

Target: 3 gold

Achievement: 2-3-9

Grade: B

SILAT missed out on their pre-games target by one gold, but overall it was still a positive outing for the squad, with many new faces showing glimpses of their potential.

Many had expected them to win two gold via the seni discipline. However, subjective sports at the Sea Games are never easy to predict.

Four-time gold medallist Al-Jufferi Jumari suffered a shoulder injury during the quarterfinals and was shown the exit in the semi-finals. Four other exponents still made it to their finals.

They were unlucky to win only one of the four finals, but the emergence of Khairi Adib Azhar, 20, certainly bodes well for the future.

PETANQUE

Target: 2 gold

Achievement: 0-1-2

Grade: D

THE team promised between two and four gold but returned with one silver and two bronze. It was the first time Malaysia had not won a gold in the sport since the 2013 edition.

SEPAK TAKRAW

Target: 0-1-2

Achievement: 0-3-2

Grade: C+

MALAYSIA again lost to Thailand in the finals of the two main events (men's team regu and inter-regu). However, it was a squad of youngsters in Hanoi.

The Sea Games will serve as a good learning experience for the players. They should come back stronger for the Cambodia edition next year.

SHOOTING

Target: 1-0-4

Achievement: 2-2-0

Grade: A

JOHNATHAN Wong had gone through some tough times — even contemplating retirement — after finishing off the podium in 2019. However, the Olympian silenced his critics by winning the men's 10m air pistol gold.

Newcomer Syasya Nadiah Mohd Arifin made it a double pistol gold for Malaysia by topping the women's event with a new Sea Games record. She was the only Malaysian to set a new regional record in Hanoi.

SWIMMING & FIN SWIMMING

Target: None

Achievement: 1-4-2

Grade: C

WHILE Malaysia remain dominant in diving in the Sea Games, the swimming squad continue to slip further behind their regional counterparts. National swimmers left the games with only one gold to show this time compared to two in Manila.

Except for Khiew Hoe Yean, there are no clear cut successors to seniors Welson Sim and Phee Jinq En, who have contributed a majority of the nation's gold medals from 2015 and 2019. The only way for the swimmers to improve is by sending them for long-term training stints abroad.

TABLE TENNIS

Target: 0-0-2

Achievement: 0-1-4

Grade: B

THE table tennis team, who could only muster two bronze in 2019, showed progress in Hanoi with a young squad.

The men had reached the final of the team event, something they had not done since the 1993 Singapore edition.

Paddlers Leong Chee Feng, Javen Choong, Wong Qi Shen and Danny Ng should be sent for training stints abroad as they have a good future ahead of them.

TAEKWONDO

Target: 1 gold

Achievement: 1-0-3

Grade: B

THE taekwondo squad scored a rare gold from the kyorugi event through Syafiq Zuber.

It was an unexpected result as Malaysia had depended on their poomsae exponents for medals in the previous editions.

It was the first time Malaysia won a kyorugi gold at a Sea Games on foreign soil since 2009.

TENNIS

Target: 0-0-2

Achievement: 0-0-2

Grade: C

ALTHOUGH tennis is popular in Malaysia, it is struggling to produce quality players.

The team did better than the 2019 edition by winning two bronze in Hanoi.

However, Malaysia will not make inroads in tennis unless players are sent abroad for tournaments and training stints.

VOLLEYBALL

Target: None

Achievement: 0-0-0

Grade: E

Winning a medal in volleyball was never going to be easy because Malaysia last won a bronze at the 2009 Laos edition.

The relevant sporting bodies may want to take a closer look at the sport and assess what is needed to revive its fortunes.

WEIGHTLIFTING

Target: 0-1-2

Achievement: 0-1-3

Grade: C+

MALAYSIAN weightlifting has gone through a lot over the past three years due to the constant doping cases.

And it was never going to be easy in Hanoi against weightlifters who have won Olympic medals.

Aznil Bidin, Erry Hidayat and Aniq Kasdan, who became the first Malaysians to win medals at the World Championships last year, renewed their national records en route to podium finishes.

The true test for the trio will be at the Birmingham Commonwealth Games later this year.

WUSHU

Target: 2 medals

Achievement: 2-1-2

Grade: A

IT is now a transition period for Malaysian wushu following the retirements of several world-class exponents.

And the Sea Games were the first big assignment for the newcomers.

Clement Ting (men's changquan) and Tan Zhi Yan (taijiquan) were the stars with a title each in Hanoi.

XIANGQI

Target: 0-2-0

Achievement: 0-2-3

Grade: C

XIANGQI or Chinese chess made its Sea Games debut in Hanoi, and the Malaysian team did well to exceed their target, finishing on the podium across four events.

The silver medallists were Sim Yip How-Yeoh Thean Jern (men's xiangqi rapid team) and Jee Xin Ru (women's standard singles).
