Cue sports need a better development programme
IT is time for the relevant sporting agencies to give Malaysian cue sports a chance to develop into a superpower.

Despite a lack of development programme and a proper training centre for almost a decade, cue sports continue to win medals in the Sea Games.

For the record, Malaysian players have also won Asian-level titles in the past.

Thanks to the Olympic Council of Malaysia (OCM) Trust Fund Committee, the Malaysian Snooker & Billiards Federation (MSBF) reopened their small training centre in Sunway, which is privately owned, to prepare the cueists for the Hanoi Sea Games.

MSBF had incurred losses as the centre could not operate due to Covid-19. The National Sports Council (NSC) provided assistance to cover some of the bills.


But MSBF can now afford to smile as, despite the difficulties, their players contributed one gold (Lim Kok Leong — six red), one silver (Lim Kok Leong — snooker singles) and one bronze (six-red — Moh Keen Hoo) to Malaysia's medal tally in Hanoi.

MSBF president Melvin Chia, also the deputy Chef de Mission of the contingent, said: "We hope to start a better programme for the players.

"Some players like Keen Hoo cannot really commit to training as they hold full-time jobs.

"A better programme will encourage more players to commit to the sport.

"Cue sports have achieved their target here."

On Kok Leong's 4-2 defeat to Thailand's James Wattana in yesterday's snooker singles final, Melvin said: "It was unfortunate as Kok Leong was controlling the match. However, his inexperience allowed Wattana back into the final.

"Wattana was not really playing well but used his experience to capitalise on Kok Leong's unforced errors.

"In snooker, a player needs experience to succeed. I believe Kok Leong has a good future ahead and a worthy replacement to the senior players in Malaysia," he added.
