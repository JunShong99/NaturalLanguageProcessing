Record-breaker Yie Bing the one to beat in pool
PETALING JAYA: Watch out for young swimmer Loo Yie Bing to sprint to glory for Sabah at the Sukma (Malaysia Games) in September.

Yie Bing is only 15 but she is now the proud holder of the 100m national record after an outstanding performance in the Malaysian Invitational Age-Group Championships (MIAG) in Bukit Jalil which ended on Sunday.
She bagged a total of seven gold medals in the girlsâ€™ Group 2 (13-14) but the highlight was her big splash in the 100m freestyle, clocking 57.56 to dip under the national record mark of 57.59 held by Chui Lai Kwan since 2009.
Lai Kwan is also from Sabah and was one of the top freestyle sprinters for Malaysia, winning the SEA Games gold medal in the 50m freestyle in Korat in 2007.

Yie Bing also swept the 50m and 200m freestyle races as well as the 50m and 100m butterfly; and also the 50m and 100m breaststroke.

Her coach back in Sabah is also none other than former Olympian and SEA Games gold medallist breaststroker Elvin Chia.

Yie Bing won the Most Outstanding Female Swimmer award after walking away with eight gold medals in the 7-12 age-group category when she last swam at the MSSM (national schools championships) in Ipoh back in 2019.
