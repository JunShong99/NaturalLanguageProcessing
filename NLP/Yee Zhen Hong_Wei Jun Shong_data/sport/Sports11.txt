Independent pairs shine in Malaysia Open
KUALA LUMPUR: While it was a good day at the office for the Malaysian independent camp, only two national pairs cleared the first round of the Malaysia Open today.

In the first half of the men's doubles opening stage, Tan Kian Meng-Tan Wee Kiong, who were promoted from the reserve list, bounced back from a first-game blemish to dismantle Danish duo Jeppe Bay-Lasse Molhede 18-21, 21-15, 21-17, setting up a date with Indonesia Open champions Liu Yu Chen-Ou Xuan Yi of China next.

The China world No 45 had earlier ousted Malaysia's Chang Yee Jun-Yap Roy King 21-14, 21-18.

Last year's World Championships bronze medal winners One Yew Sin-Teo Ee Yi also cleared the first round without much difficulty, chalking up a 21-19, 21-13 win over another national combination who were promoted from the reserve list, Wan Arif Wan Junaidi-Haikal Nazri, 21-19, 21-13.
World No 10 Yew Sin-Ee Yi will take on fourth seeds and reigning Olympic champions Lee Yang-Wang Chi Lin of Taiwan next on Thursday.


In the final match of the day, German Open champions Goh Sze Fei-Nur Izzuddin Rumsani made easy work of Japan's Keiichiro Matsui-Yoshinori Takeuchi by winning 21-12, 21-12 and will face seventh seeds Satwiksairaj Rankireddy-Chirag Shetty of India next.
The Indian combination, who were inspirational in their country's Thomas Cup success in Bangkok last month, defeated Syed Modi International champions Man Wei Chong-Tee Kai Wun 21-18, 21-11.

It was also the end of the road for Goh V Shem-Low Juan Shen who went down tamely 21-18, 21-9 to the in-form Indonesian pairing of Fajar Alfian and Muhammad Rian Ardianto.

The world No 7 Indonesians, who bagged the Indonesia Masters title earlier this month, will face Germany's Mark Lamfuss-Marvin Seidel in the second round.

In the men's singles event, veteran Liew Daren put up a good fight but was unable to see off India's Thomas Cup winner H.S. Prannoy as he went down 21-14, 17-21, 21-18.

Daren, who had defeated Prannoy at the Thailand Open last month, believes he will find time to recover before the Super 500 Malaysia Masters next week.

"My condition has not been the best since the Thailand Open, and I've not really had the time to prepare well. There's always going to be a winner and a loser, this is normal. I'll try to come back stronger next week after some rest," said the former World Championships bronze medal winner.

In the mixed doubles, another Commonwealth Games bound pair, Chan Peng Soon-Cheah Yee See crashed out of the competition, following a 9-21, 21-12, 22-20 defeat at the hands of Indonesia's Rinov Rivaldy-Pitha Haningtyas Mentari.

Earlier, world No 9 Tan Kian Meng-Lai Pei Jing went down in three games 21-18, 19-21, 21-18 to compatriots Goh Soon Huat-Shevon Lai.

BAM's Choong Hon Jian-Peck Yen Wei gave a good fight, but Hong Kong's world No 7 Tang Chun Man-Tse Ying Suet were just too strong for the Malaysians as they went on to notch a 21-18, 21-18 win in 37 minutes.

In the women's doubles first round, Low Yeen Yuan-Valeree Siow put up a brilliant show for the Malaysian fans, as the young pair fought tooth and nail for an hour and 13 minutes before scoring a 17-21, 21-16, 21-19 stunner over world No 24 Linda Efler-Isabel Lohau of Germany.

The world No 74 Malaysians, however, face another uphill battle as they take on world No 1 Chen Qing Chen-Jia Yi Fan of China next.
