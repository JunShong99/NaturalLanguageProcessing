Zii Jia ends Malaysia’s 17-year wait at Thailand Open
BANGKOK: Lee Zii Jia won the Thailand Open men’s singles title after bouncing back in the rubber game against China’s Li Shi Feng at the Impact Arena today.

In doing so, he became the third Malaysian to win the title.
The world No 6 fought back from a game down to beat unseeded Shi Feng 17-21, 21-11, 23-21 in 70 minutes.

He trailed Shi Feng 11-4 in the decider but clawed his way back to tie at 21-21. He then stepped up the tempo to pull away and win 23-21.

The two other Malaysians to win the title are Yong Hock Kin (2001) and Hafiz Hashim (2005). It is Zii Jia’s second consecutive success after the independent player captured the Badminton Asia Championships (BAC) crown in Manila earlier this month.

“It was a tough match. Shi Feng played well not only today but the entire tournament. He’s a tough opponent. I’m happy to make it through,” said Zii Jia.

“I told myself to not give up when I was down 11-4. At that crucial moment, I calmed myself down and kept my cool.”

Zii Jia admitted he was mentally and physically tired after going through two high-intensity tournaments – the BAC and Thomas Cup but fought hard for the title.

“I wanted this title very much,” he said.

Zii Jia pocketed US$27,000 while Shi Feng settled for US$13,680.

Meanwhile, Taiwanese Tai Tzu Ying won the women’s singles title after defeating China’s Chen Yufei 21-13, 17-21, 21-12.

In women’s doubles, Japanese pair Nami Matsuyama-Chiharu Shida beat compatriots Mayu Matsumoto-Wakana Nagahara 17-21, 21-15, 26-24.

Over in men’s doubles, Takuro Hoki-Yugo Kobayashi lifted the title after Indonesian duo Fajar Alfian-Rian Ardianto withdrew.
