Pandelela qualifies for platform semis at world meet.
KUALA LUMPUR: Pandelela Rinong eased any doubts of pre-competition jitters as she booked her spot in the semi-finals of the women's 10m platform individual event at the World Championships in Budapest today.

The 29-year-old finished fourth in the preliminary round with a 332.10 total.

Pandelela was third behind China's Chen Yuxi and Quan Hongchan after four attempts but a 59.20 effort — her lowest score on the day — in her fifth and last dive saw her drop to fourth.

Brazilian Ingrid Oliveira who produced a 75.20 effort in her last dive, leapfrogged Pandelela to take third spot.
Reigning world champion Yuxi was way ahead in first place with a total of 413.95 points while Olympic gold medalist Hongchan was second with 410.85.


It was still a solid showing by Pandelela, who finished well ahead of her main Commonwealth Games rivals — Canada's Caeli McKay (6th), Australia's Emily Boyd (14th) and Britain's Andrea Spendolini-Sirieix (19th).

Pandelela, who won the World Cup last year, still needs to keep her focus for the semi-finals, which will be held later today.

The top 18 qualifiers will compete in the semi-finals from which the top 12 will make the final.

Meanwhile, Nur Dhabitah Sabri who was initially listed for the 10m platform individual event dropped out at the eleventh hour.

The 22-year-old, who claimed two gold medals at the Hanoi Sea Games, will instead focus on the 3m springboard synchro (with Wendy Ng) and the platform synchro (with Pandelela).

"We want to focus on the events that we are stronger at and that is why Dhabitah will only compete in the synchro events," said Malaysia Swimming (MS) secretary-general Mae Chen.
