Teen squash prodigy Whitney shows her class
KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian squash prodigy Whitney Isabelle Wilson, 14, is a step away from her first major final.

She showed her pedigree with an emphatic 11-4, 11-2, 14-12 win over Hong Kong's Elaine Chung in the girls' Under-15 quarter-finals at the Asian Junior Championships in Pattaya, Thailand, today.

Whitney, who could be the next Datuk Nicol Ann David, will take on top seed Anahat Singh of India in the last four.

Anahat, who won the British Junior Open Under-11 title in 2019, prevented an all-Malaysian affair by beating Doyce Lee 11-3, 11-4, 11-4.

In the girls' Under-13, Malaysia's top seed Harleein Tan, who is also the British Open Junior Under-11 champion, outclassed India's Aarika Mishra 11-1, 11-1, 11-3.


Harleein will meet compatriot Yek Rui Jean, who downed India's Nimrit Pashricha 9-11, 11-4, 11-8, 11-8, in the semi-finals.

In the girls' Under-19, top seed Aira Azman stayed on track for her fifth Asian Junior title after beating her Malaysian compatriot, K. Sehveetrraa, 11-8, 4-11, 11-8, 11-6. Aira will meet teammate Yee Xin Ying next.

In the boys' Under-17, Harith Danial and Low Was Sern reached the semi-finals.

"I thought Harleein played really well, and she has been in good form in this tournament," said national assistant head coach Andrew Cross.

"Whitney also played very well, although she dropped her performance a little in the third game. She has a huge match against Anahat in the semi-final, and that's going to be a real test for her."
