Jun Hoong makes it to Tokyo Olympics after IOC U-turn
KUALA LUMPUR: Former world diving champion Cheong Jun Hoong has regained her ticket to the Tokyo Olympics next month after a dramatic U-turn by the International Swimming Federation (Fina), according to Malaysia Swimming today.

Malaysia Swimming secretary-general Mae Chan said Fina and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) had reversed their decision and included the top 18 divers in the women’s 10m individual platform in the 2021 Fina Diving World Cup for the Olympics.

“We are happy to inform you that Jun Hoong has gotten her slot back to the Olympics. Thank you to the newly elected Fina president Husain Al Musallam.

“Fina and IOC have reversed their decision and included the top 18 divers for the Olympics,” she told reporters via WhatsApp.

Mae said this news was received via email from Fina yesterday.

Meanwhile, in a Facebook posting, youth and sports minister Reezal Merican Naina Merican welcomed the positive turn of events.

He thanked the Olympic Council of Malaysia and the national swimming body for their hard work in ensuring that the national divers performed at their best and qualified on merit.

Jun Hoong, 31, will now join four other national women divers who had qualified earlier for the Olympics, namely Pandelela Rinong (10m platform and 10m platform synchro), Nur Dhabitah Sabri (3m springboard), Wendy Ng Yan Yee (3m springboard) and Leong Mun Yee (10m platform synchro).

Last Wednesday, Malaysia Swimming said Jun Hoong had missed the cut for the Tokyo Olympics after Fina decided to allow only the best 15 divers in the women’s 10m individual platform in the Diving World Cup to qualify for the world’s biggest sporting event.

In the 2021 World Cup, Jung Hoong finished last in the women’s 10m individual platform semifinals but still emerged among the top 18 divers in the championship to qualify for the Olympics, before Fina decided to allow only the top 15 divers to go to Tokyo.
