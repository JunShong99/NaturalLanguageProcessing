Welson moves on with plans Down Under for next year's competitions
Swimmer Welson Sim indicates that he would like to return to Melbourne to prepare for major assignments next year.

The Sarawakian was far from his best in his second Olympic outing in Tokyo as he failed to rewrite the national records for the 200m and 400m freestyle events.

Although Welson clocked a season's best of 1:49.24s to finish 29th overall in the 200m freestyle on Sunday, it was far off his national record of 1:47.36, set in 2017.

On Saturday, he clocked a poor 3:58.25, seven seconds off his national record, in the 400m heats to finish 33rd overall.
The 24-year-old, however, is not giving up on his swimming career yet as he feels he is still good enough to continue until the 2024 Paris Olympics.


"Yes, my 400m race was not impressive, but I think I did well to clock a season's best in the 200m, considering that we swimmers did not get regular competitions for more than a year due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

"Training in Malaysia is good as you will get all the required support, especially from the National Sports Institute.

"However, training overseas offers a different perspective as you get to spar with higher-ranked swimmers, who will push you hard.

Welson spent the first half of last year training in Melbourne alongside big names such as Mack Horton, and he showed some impressive results during the period.

He also had stints in Melbourne in 2017 and 2018.

"I will have to speak to Malaysia Swimming to see what their plans are for us as we have three major events next year â€” Hanoi Sea Games, Birmingham Commonwealth Games and Hangzhou Asian Games.

"Of course, I also hope to qualify for my third Olympics in Paris."

Training abroad does hold an advantage, especially for swimmers in Asia.
