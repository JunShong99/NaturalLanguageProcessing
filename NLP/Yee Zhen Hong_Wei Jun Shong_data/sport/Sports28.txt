World class prep for Pandelela and Co
MALAYSIAN divers will use the World Aquatics Championships in Budapest, Hungary, from June 18-July 3 as a warm-up for the Commonwealth Games.

The Commonwealth meet in Birmingham from July 28-Aug 8 is their main priority as diving there is viewed as Malaysia's gold medal prospects.

With that in mind, Malaysia Swimming (MS), who have named an 10-member squad for the World Championships, will focus mainly on events that will also be held in the Commonwealth Games.
"Our main priority is the Commonwealth Games. We are likely to skip some of the events at the World Championships as we don't want our divers to overexert themselves," said MS secretary-general Mae Chen.
"Our focus will be mostly on the 3m springboard and the 10m platform because those are events in which we are stronger.

"But of course the final lineup will only be decided by the coaches during the team managers' meeting on June 26, a day before the actual diving competition."

Malaysia's women's team will comprise four-time Olympian Pandelela Rinong, Nur Dhabitah Sabri, Wendy Ng and Ong Ker Ying.

The men's team consist of Ooi Tze Liang, Chew Yiwei, Syafiq Puteh, Hanis Nazirul Surya Jaya, Jellson Jabillin and Gabriel Gilbert Daim.

Pandelela is set for double duty in the individual and synchro events of the 10m platform.

Dhabitah, who bagged two gold medals at the recent Hanoi Sea Games, is also set for double duty in the 3m and 10m synchro where she will pair up with Wendy and Pandelela respectively.

Mae added that three swimmers — Sea Games gold medallist Khiew Hoe Yean, Phee Jinq En and Goh Chia Tong — will also compete in the World Championships.
