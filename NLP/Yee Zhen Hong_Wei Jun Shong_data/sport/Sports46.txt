A day of pleasant surprises for Malaysia
HANOI: The Malaysian contingent rewrote a number of national records as they continued to win medals – some of them totally unexpected – at the Hanoi Sea Games today.

The silat squad delivered the first gold of the day for Malaysia through Khairi Adib Azhar in the men's Under-55kg class. Three other exponents: Siti Shazwana Ajak (women's Under-70kg), Siti Rahmah Mohamed Nasir (women's Under-75kg) and Billage Nakang (men's Under-110kg) had to settle for silver.

Artistic gymnast Rachel Yeoh, who won the uneven bars gold on Saturday, came up with a surprise gold in the women's balance beam despite competing against a strong field, including the highly rated Filipina Aleah Finnegan.
Sprinter Nor Sarah Adi – who was focusing more on the 4x100m – unexpectedly won the women's pole vault and easily too, despite having limited time to prepare for the event. Sarah went on to help S. Komalam Shally, Zaidatul Husniah Zulkifli, Azreen Nabila Alias win a bronze in the women's 4x100m relay.

The men's 4x100m squad (Arsyad Md Saat, Zulfiqar Ismail, Azeem Mohd Fahmi, Haiqal Hanafi) were also impressive as they renewed the national record en route to silver in the event. Queenie Ting also bettered her national record en route to silver in the women's discus. Savinder Kaur Jogindr Singh bagged a bronze in the 800m.

In swimming, Khiew Hoe Yean splashed his way to two silver medals via the men's 200m backstroke and 400m freestyle.

Shooter Hafiz Adzha nailed a silver in the men's 25m rapid fire pistol event.

Taekwondo trio Nurul Hidayah Abdul Karim, Nur Humaira Abdul Karim and Lim Jia Wei earned a bronze in the women's team poomsae while Jason Loo claimed silver in the men's individual category.
