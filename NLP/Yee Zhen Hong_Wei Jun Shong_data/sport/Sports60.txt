Pandelela-Mun Yee fail to deliver Malaysia's first medal in Tokyo
KUALA LUMPUR: All hopes were on Pandelela Rinong-Leong Mun Yee to win Malaysia's first medal at the Tokyo Olympics, but the pair instead finished last in the eight-pair women's 10m platform synchro final on Tuesday.

Pandelela-Mun Yee, the reigning World Championships silver medallists, garnered only 277.98 points at the Olympic Aquatic Centre.

The Malaysians lost ground after poor dives on their third, fourth and fifth attempts on the platform.

It was a disappointing blow for the Malaysian contingent who were counting on Pandelela-Mun Yee to deliver the nation's first medal at the Olympics.
China's Chen Yuxi-Zhang Jiaqi put up a near flawless performance as they dominated from start to finish to clinch gold with 363.78 points.


United State' Jessica-Parratto-Delaney Schnell took the silver with a distant 310.80 while Mexico's Gabriela Garcia-Alejandra Orozco Loza finished third on 299.70.
