Malaysia reap profit from middleman
PETALING JAYA: If there is one player famed for keeping the engine room running, it is Nor Azam Azih.

Despite Pahang’s average start in the Super League, where they are in eighth position with eight points from eight games, the 27-year-old midfielder has been impressive for the Elephants, with three goals from seven games.

But it’s not just the goals that have defined him – his control, brilliant movement in midfield and intelligent passes have made him one of the best playmakers in the country.

And it was no surprise to see him in the national team and he repaid coach Kim Pan-gon’s faith in him with a sterling display in Malaysia’s 2-0 friendly win over Hong Kong.

Now part of the 23-men squad for the AFC Asian Cup 2023 final round qualifiers in Kuala Lumpur, Azam will surely be a mainstay for Harimau Malaya.

Malaysia will start their campaign against Turkmenistan tomorrow and then face Bahrain (June 11) and Bangladesh (June 14).

All matches will be played at the National Stadium in Bukit Jalil.
Azam, who has won 16 caps with Malaysia, said Pan-gon had brought lots of changes to the game with an emphasis on progressive football.

“The level he demands is quite high. All the boys will have to be at their best, whether in training or during games.

“Even in friendlies, he wants us to maintain a high level of football,” he said.

Azam said based on their two friendly wins, he believes Malaysia have what it takes to put themselves in contention to qualify for the Asian Cup next year.

“There is a good chance we can get to the Asian Cup.

“The players are looking confident and are willing to work as one. We will keep this vibe going.”
