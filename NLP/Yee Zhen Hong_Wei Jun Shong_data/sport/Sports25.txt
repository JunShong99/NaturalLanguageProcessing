Bryan and Arvin get green light to compete in their maiden Games
PETALING JAYA: Promising swimmers Bryan Leong and Arvin Singh Chalal have got the nod to make their Commonwealth Games debut.

The duo will join Vietnam SEA Games gold medallist Khiew Hoe Yean and Tokyo Olympian breaststroker Phee Jinq En in Birmingham next month.

Hoe Yean and Jinq En qualified on merit while the notable absentee is former Olympian Welson Sim, who has left the national team.

An athlete needs to finish in the top four to be considered for qualification under category A while it is top six for category B.

Malaysia Swimming secretary Mae Chen is grateful to the National Sports Council and Olympic Council of Malaysia for allowing two more younger swimmers.

“We recommended Bryan as he set a new national record in the men’s 50m freestyle at the Hanoi SEA Games,” said Mae.

The 19-year-old butterfly and freestyle sprinter erased the previous national record of 23.10 seconds held by Keith Lim since 2018 with his time of 23.09.
However, he did not make it to the podium.

“Arvin also achieved three personal best marks in Hanoi and was part of the 4x200m freestyle relay team who won the silver medal,” said Mae.

Arvin, who made his SEA Games debut in the Philippines with bronze in the men’s 4x200m freestyle relay, is a middle distance swimmer.

“Hoe Yean and Jinq En did not return after the world championships in Budapest as they are now training at the University of Sterling in England with coach Chris Martin. From there, they will head straight to Birmingham,” said Mae.
