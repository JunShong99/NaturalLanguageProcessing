Road cyclist Aiman shines for Malaysia
HANOI: The Malaysian contingent added another gold medal to their haul on the penultimate day of the Sea Games today.

After the disappointment of missing out on a medal in the men's criterium on Thursday, the national cycling squad bounced back today to win the coveted road race through Nur Aiman Zariff.

The five-man cycling squad of Akmal Hakim Zakaria, Nur Amirull Fakhruddin Mazuki, Nur Aiman Rosli and Zawawi Azman got their tactics spot on and ensure their rider in the breakaway - Aiman Zariff - win the race in Hoa Binh

Aiman outkicked three rivals in the breakaway group in a sprint finish.
Aiman's victory made it a total of 37 gold for Malaysia who lie in sixth place on the medal table.


It was the first time Malaysia won the Sea Games men's road race since 2015 in Singapore.

In weightlifting, Erry Hidayat, the son of former Commonwealth Games champion Hidayat Hamidun, set a new national record en route to bagging a bronze in the men's under-73kg category.

In snooker, Lim Kok Leong stayed on course for a second gold medal in Hanoi after advancing to the 15-red final tomorrow.

Kok Leong, who earlier this week won the six-red singles gold, routed Thailand's Passakorn Suwanawat 4-0 (95-21, 68-64, 99-0, 66-40) in the semi-final today.

Besides snooker, Malaysia hope to win more gold through Muay Thai, badminton and road cycling tomorrow.
