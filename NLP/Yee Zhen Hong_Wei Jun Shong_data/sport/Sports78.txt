Fans can watch top pros play for free in Bukit Jalil
PETALING JAYA: The Squash Racquets Association of Malaysia (SRAM) are banking on the presence of Malaysia’s professional players led by world No. 23 Ng Eain Yow (pic) and world No. 19 S. Sivasangari to lure the local fans to the National Squash Championships at the National Squash Centre in Bukit Jalil.

The 37th edition of the tournament, making a return after being cancelled due to Covid-19, will see the likes of four-time winner Ivan Yuen (No. 56), Mohd Syafiq Kamal (No. 84) and Addeen Idrakie (No. 86) as well as Rachel Arnold (No. 37), Aifa Azman (No. 28) and Chan Yiwen (No. 81) joining Eain Yow and Sivasangari to add spice to the event.

It will be free entry for the fans as SRAM are encouraging them to return to the courts as the tournament has attracted a total of 302 players in various senior categories.

“We had a void after the retirement of Nicol David but there has been a lot of encouragement as our players have been doing well abroad. There will be no tickets and we urge the fans to watch the professional players in action at the National Squash Centre,” said SRAM president Gerard Monteiro.

SRAM director of coaching Major (rtd) S. Maniam said the tournament gives a rare opportunity for the fans to get up close and personal with Eain Yow and Sivasangari, who are based in Reading, England, and New York respectively.

“The fans may have watched Yow and Sangari in television but this is the chance to see them live. They would also get the chance to take photographs and selfies during the event,” said Maniam.

“With the World Junior Championships around the corner, the National Championships will also give us an avenue to test our junior players against the professionals.”
The world junior meet will be held in France from Aug 11-21 and the national championships will also give SRAM the chance to finalise their squad.
