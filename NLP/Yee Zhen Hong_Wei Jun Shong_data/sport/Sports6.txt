KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia crashed out of the Under-23 Asian Cup football tournament after falling 3-0 to Thailand in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, yesterday.

The Sea Games silver medallists found their second goal in the 69th minute through midfielder Channarong Promsrikaew who beat three defenders before slotting the ball past goalkeeper Rahadiazli Rahalim.


In the 73rd minute, the Young Elephants put the match beyond Malaysia's reach with Suphanat hitting his second goal.
Malaysia had eight shots at goals but nothing came off it.
