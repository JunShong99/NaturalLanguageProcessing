Malaysia Open 2022: How to watch Lee Zii Jia live in action on home soil
After withdrawing from the Commonwealth Games, the world number five confirmed he will take part in the back-to-back World Tour legs on home soil starting with the Malaysia Open.
Lee Zii Jia will be looking to return to his winning ways playing in his third badminton World Tour event in four weeks, as he returns home for the Malaysia Open 2022 from 28 June to 3 July.

The world number five had a strong outing in Jakarta which saw him just miss making the finals of the Indonesia Open, falling to reigning Olympic champion Viktor Axelsen in the semi-finals. A week earlier he got ousted in the quarter-finals of the Indonesia Masters.

The 24-year-old now embarks on another fortnight of back-to-back competitions with the Malaysia Masters 2022 scheduled the following week from 5 to 10 July. It's the first time the tour will return to Malaysia since the global pandemic.

The grueling World Tour Schedule coupled with major tournaments has led Lee to share with local journalists that he will not be participating in the Commonwealth Games 2022 at the end of July as he sets his sights to be at his best for the BWF World Championships in Tokyo from 21 to 29 August.

"I have decided not to play in the Commonwealth Games, and it is a tough decision, which I made after speaking to my team" Lee shared with The New Straits Times, adding " I have been playing non-stop and need to take care of my body condition."
