Welson and Co finish second but disqualified minutes later
JOY turned to sorrow in a space of five minutes for the Malaysian men’s swimming relay quartet of Khiew Hoe Yean, Arvin Shaun Singh, Lim Yin Chuen and Welson Sim.

The quartet clocked 3:20.13 and thought they had taken an unexpected silver medal for Malaysia on the opening night of SEA Games swimming action at the My Dinh Aquatic Centre but they were disqualified.

Arvin was faulted for having jumped into the pool earlier and the quartet were disqualified while they were still congratulating each other for their efforts.

The Singaporean quartet of Maximillian Ang, Mitchell Ang, Ardi Zulhilmi and Darren Chua won the race in 3:17.19 but their result was also struck off for the false start.

Swimming has a no false-start rule now, meaning anybody who beats the buzzer is immediately disqualified.

Vietnam were promoted to gold from third (3:21.81) with Indonesia awarded the silver in 3:24.09.

The poster boy of Vietnamese sports Nguyen Huy Hoang earlier bagged the first gold medal on offer when the 20-year-old came out tops in 15:00.75, just missing out on his own SEA Games record of 14:58.14 he clocked in winning the long distance event at the Philippines SEA Games in 2019.
The 14:58.14 effort then made him the first South-East Asian swimmer to dip under 15 seconds for the 1500m freestyle and earned him a place at the Tokyo Olympics under category A.

Huy Hoang, who carried the flag for Vietnam in the opening ceremony on May 12, is hotly favoured to sweep the 400m and 800m freestyle titles as well.

Vietnam claimed the silver as well through Nguyen Huu Kim Son, who finished in 15:27.31 while Tonnam Kanteemol finished ahead of Malaysia’s Sebastian Soon for the bronze.

The Thai youngster clocked 15:33.54 while Sebastian finished the race in 15:39.87. SEA Games debutant Tan Khai Xin of Malaysia placed fifth in 16:04.91.

Bao Pham Thanh broke the Games record in taking a second gold for the host nation in the men’s 100m breaststroke final.

The Vietnamese finished in 1:01.17, breaking the Games record of 1:01.46 set by James Deiparine of the Philippines in the 2019 edition.

Singapore’s Maximillian Ang took home silver in 1:01.58 while Ng Jing Fu was sixth in 1:03.61.

Quah Jing Wen clinched Singapore’s first gold medal in style by winning the women’s 200m butterfly in a new Games record of 2:09.52.

The 21-year-old won the event for the third straight time after finishing ahead of Vietnam’s My Thao Le Thi (2:14.20) and Thailand’s Kwanmuang Kamonchanok (2:14.35).

Jing Wen returned shortly to claim a second gold for Singapore, winning the women’s 200m individual medley in 2:15.98.
