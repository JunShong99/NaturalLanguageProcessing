KUALA LUMPUR: World No 5 Lee Zii Jia has stormed into the quarter-finals of the Indonesia Masters to move a step closer to winning his third title in as many tournaments.

The 24-year-old continued his sizzling form by whipping Dutchman Mark Caljouw 21-17, 21-14 in 37 minutes at the Istora Senayan in Jakarta today.

World No 27 Caljouw became the 14th different player that Zii Jia has defeated as he took his winning streak to 15 matches.

Zii Jia will most likely face Indonesia's Anthony Ginting, the two-time winner of the Super 500 event, for a place in the semi-finals tomorrow.
Also through to the last eight were third seed Chou Tien Chen of Taiwan, seventh seed Lakhsya Sen of India and eighth seed Loh Kean Yew of Singapore.


In the men's doubles, Aaron Chia-Soh Wooi Yik and Goh Sze Fei-Nur Izzuddin Rumsani kept the country's flag flying high when they sailed into the quarter-finals.
Aaron-Wooi Yik, the semi-finalists in 2020 and 2021, made it four wins in a row against Indonesia's Leo Rolly Carnando-Daniel Marthin with a 27-25, 21-14 victory while Sze Fei-Izzuddin survived a scare before taming homesters Sabar Karyaman Gutama-Moh Reza Pahlevi Isfahani 23-21, 17-21, 21-9.

The two pairs can make it an all-Malaysian semi-final if they win their next round. Aaron-Wooi Yik look more likely to advance as they face Chinese youngsters Liang Wei Keng-Wang Chang but Sze Fei-Izzuddin have a daunting task against three-time winners and world No 1 Kevin Sanjaya-Marcus Fernaldi Gideon.

The women's doubles of Pearly Tan-M. Thinaah also brought cheers to the Malaysian camp after outlasting South Korea's Baek Ha Na-Lee Yu Lim 21-23, 21-17, 21-15.

Vivian Hoo-Lim Chiew Sien failed to take advantage of their 15-6 commanding lead in the second game as they fell 21-17, 21-19 to homesters Apriyani Rahayu-Siti Fadia Silva Ramadhanti.

In the mixed doubles, Malaysia's challenge has come an end after none of the two remaining pairs made it past the last 16 stage.

Hoo Pang Ron-Toh Ee Wei ended their campaign after going down fighting 20-22, 21-5, 21-15 to two-time World Championships bronze medallists Tang Chun Man-Tse Ying Suet of Hong Kong.

Chan Peng Soon and Cheah Yee See were forced to pull out from their match against South Korea' Seo Seung Jae-Chae Yu Jung after Peng Soon suffered food poisoning.

Peng Soon-Yee See had earlier defeated compatriots Soong Joo Ven-Goh Liu Ying 21-17, 21-10 in the first round.
