Silver lining caps good run for cyclists in Hanoi
THE national cycling squad capped their campaign at the Hanoi Sea Games with another two silver medals through the women's individual and team road race events yesterday.

Nur Aisyah Zubir was just pipped to the individual gold by Vietnam's Nguyen Thi That, who won the race in two hours, 13 minutes and 15 seconds (88.5km).

Indonesia's Delia Ayustina Priatna, who was the only other rider in the breakaway group, claimed the bronze (same time).

Malaysia also claimed the silver in the team category on a combined time of 6:42:15s.

The other riders in the team were Siti Nur Adibah Akma, Nur Aisyah Munirah Chek Ramli and Ju Pha Som Net (+1:13s) and Aisyah Munirah (+1:17s).


Ju Pha, however, suffered a crash in the closing stages of the race.

Vietnam won the team gold in 6:42:11s while Thailand came in third (6:43:48s).

The men's road race on Saturday did not feature a team category. Aisyah Zubir had on Thursday claimed bronze in the women's criterium.

Team manager Firdaus Arshad said he was pleased to see Aisyah Zubir secure the individual silver but believed they could have challenged for the gold if not for Ju Pha's crash.

"We are grateful to secure another two silver medals on the final day of the competition," said Firdaus.

"It was great to see Aisyah Zubir finishing the race strongly and taking the individual silver.

"We are, however, slightly disappointed not to win the team event gold as we had a chance of doing so until the final kilometre when Ju Pha crashed.

"But I am still pleased with our overall results here in both the mountain bike and road events."

Malaysia enjoyed a strong outing in cycling in Hanoi â€” winning one gold, one silver and one bronze through the mountain bike events; and one gold, two silver and two bronze via the road discipline.

Malaysia only won one bronze in cycling at the 2019 edition.
