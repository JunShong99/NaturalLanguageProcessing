PETALING JAYA: National women’s No 1 squash player S Sivasangari is out of the Commonwealth Games after being seriously injured in a car crash.

The world No 19 suffered injuries to the head in the accident which occurred along the Maju Expressway yesterday, New Straits Times reported.

Sivasangari was a passenger in the car when it rear-ended a lorry. She was rescued from the vehicle before it caught fire and rushed to Hospital Putrajaya, where she underwent surgery.

The Commonwealth Games will take place from July 28 to Aug 8 in Birmingham, England.
The Kedah-born Sivasangari was a medal hopeful in the women’s individual and doubles events.

The 23-year-old won her second national championship title this month and was set to be the Malaysian contingent’s flag-bearer alongside Paralympian Bonnie Bunyau Gustin in Birmingham.
