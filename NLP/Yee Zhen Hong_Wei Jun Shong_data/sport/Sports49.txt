A quiet splash for swimmers?
Malaysian swimmers are not expected to make waves when the Sea Games competition begins today in Hanoi.

It will be a challenge even to match Malaysia's haul of two gold, two silver and three bronze at the 2019 Manila Sea Games.

Singapore, who won 23 gold,10 silver and four bronze in 2019 and powered by former Olympic champion Joseph Schooling, and Vietnam (10-6-9) are the sharks at the pool in Hanoi.

Team manager Tan Chin Chin said: "Our 14 athletes arrived in Hanoi on Wednesday and have been testing the waters and training."
Welson Sim said he hopes to win back the 200m freestyle gold, which was prised away by Singapore's Darren Chua in the Manila edition.


"I want to get back my 200m free gold and also the 100m freestyle."
