Lontong darat and laksa Johor at this Bukit Damansara bungalow
Looking for someplace different, ambience-wise, to have a good meal? If you’re in the vicinity of Bukit Damansara in Kuala Lumpur, one establishment worth visiting is this family-run business called Kecur.

What makes this place stand out is that diners are treated to Johorean and other Malaysian comfort food in a big, beautifully designed bungalow. As it turns out, “kecur” is the Malay word for “to salivate” – an apt name for sure!

Tables and chairs of different shapes and sizes are sprawled within the living room and in the garden. Sitting outside would probably be lovely in the mornings, but if it’s hot or rainy when you arrive, the indoors would surely be your pick.

The menu changes from time to time, and ordering is done via a mobile device. Mouthwatering favourites served here include Hainanese chicken chop, satay, nasi ulam, and mee bandung.

On the menu when this writer visited were two classics from the southern state: lontong darat and laksa Johor.

Lontong, of course, is the dish of Indonesian origin made of compressed rice in a cylindrical shape, often wrapped in a banana leaf. It often comes served “wet” with a sauce or curry, but the variation at Kecur is, by comparison, dry – which makes sense, given “darat” means “land”.

Still, it comes with a thick sambal or kuah that gives it a strong taste profile and pairs really well with the steamed nasi impit. You could probably have this weekly and not get bored.

The laksa Johor, too, had a thick flavoursome gravy and plenty of fresh chopped vegetables. The noodle was spaghetti, which is not unexpected for this traditional dish. It tasted as any competent laksa Johor should – a thumbs up!

While the food here is certainly above average, with reasonable prices to boot, it is the unique environment that really makes a visit to Kecur worthwhile. If you’re into one-of-a-kind dining, do check it out.
