Piquant prawn mee at Pasar Pagi Kangar, Perlis
When it comes to hawker food, there’s certainly no shortage of options in the northern states. After all, Penang is known as THE food hub of the north, while Ipoh, of course, is synonymous with chicken rice.

It’s not too often, though, that you read about food in Kangar, Perlis. To be fair, it’s not really known as a holiday destination, but to say this humble town is not worth visiting would be doing it a disservice, given the scrumptious fare served up at the central morning market (Pasar Pagi Kangar).

Of note is a hawker stall located at Mahkota Restoran nearby. There are a few such kopitiam in the vicinity of this market; this one is located on your right as you walk in from the parking area.

This stall offers loh mee – the type with the thick, dark, savoury gravy – as well as prawn mee, which is also known as Hokkien mee in the northern states.

For a hearty meal, you must try a steaming bowl of the prawn mee, which comes with the standard seafood, pork slices, half a boiled egg, fried pork lard, your choice of noodles, and bean sprouts.

You can add more texture and flavour with “extras” such as pork head skin and intestines, which are delicious if you’re into these sorts of things.

The ingredients were well cooked and had just the right texture. More importantly, the soup and sambal were on point – so much so that you might even argue it beats most of the Hokkien mee found in Penang… though don’t let any of the island’s faithful hear you say that!

Mahkota Restoran serves some pretty awesome coffee, too. So if you find yourself in Perlis hankering for something hot, spicy and delicious, this is the place to check out.
