‘Tapau’-worthy rojak, or pasembur, in SS15 Subang Jaya
The word “rojak” in the Klang Valley can be confusing if you’re from Penang. For Penangites, it refers to the awesome street food with cut fruits in thick dark sauce made of prawn paste, sugar, lime and chilli paste. Klang Valley folks call that “Penang rojak” or “rojak buah”.

The rojak in the Klang Valley is known as “pasembur” in Penang, which has nothing to do with fruits altogether. Perhaps this whole thing has ties to the “Hokkien mee vs prawn mee” debate, who knows?

Anyway, when it comes to Klang Valley rojak, there’s no shortage of rojak stalls. But if you’re in the vicinity of SS15, Subang Jaya, one place you should try is this former truck that used to be parked close to Taylor’s and Inti colleges.

It now operates from a coffee shop at Subang Square, a stone’s throw from its former location.

Despite its new premises, the setup is very spartan, with two stalls – one for rojak, the other for cendol, its other offering – and a self-service counter.

The hygiene, however, at this “new” joint is a bit questionable… a vestige of the old roadside truck mentality, perhaps.

The good news is, the rojak gets a thumbs up. The ingredients are fresh: crisp sengkuang and juicy cucumber smothered with a thick, flavourful peanut sauce that’s not too spicy.

There are other deep-fried crunchy bits, too, making it an enjoyable dish, overall.

The cendol here, like most rojak van cendol, was just OK. It’s fine if you need a drink, but is otherwise not particularly noteworthy.

All in all, this place is worth visiting if you’re looking to tapau a delicious serving of fresh rojak/pasembur, though dining-in requires a bit of a Bear Grylls mentality.
