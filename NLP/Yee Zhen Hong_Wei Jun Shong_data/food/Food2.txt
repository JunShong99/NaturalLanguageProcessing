Delicious dry curry mee at Ipoh’s Nam Chau kopitiam
[NON-HALAL]

When it comes to Ipoh food, the first thing that springs to most Malaysians’ minds is chicken rice – steamed white chicken with crisp bean sprouts – or shredded chicken kuey teow, also 
known as “kai si hor fun”.
But there’s a lesser-known hawker dish that’s not often found outside this tin-mining town that’s worth mentioning – dry curry noodles.

And if you’re in Ipoh Old Town, you need to try it at Restoran Nam Chau, located a stone’s throw away from Thean Chun kopitiam, known for the abovementioned “kai si hor fun”.

Parking in this area is often a bit challenging but, with a bit of patience, it is not impossible.

Nam Chou only has one stall that offers dry and soupy curry mee, in addition to other noodle dishes such as lam mee and glass noodles. It also offers the typical Malaysian breakfast set
 of half-boiled egg and toast, and even sandwiches.
The dry curry mee is a simple dish – boiled yellow noodles and bee hoon, a few slices of char siew, prawns, those awesome bean sprouts Ipoh is famous for, and some mint leaves.

The entire dish is then drenched in thick, creamy and spicy curry, and a squeeze of lime juice ties everything together.

If this is your first time trying the dish, you will quickly become a fan; and if you come on Sundays, you get to add cockles and roast pork to the mix as well. The breakfast set and
 coffee here are also worth ordering.

So, if you ever find yourself in the vicinity – heck, why not go on a road trip from the Klang Valley on the weekend? – make Nam Chau your go-to spot for a good meal!
