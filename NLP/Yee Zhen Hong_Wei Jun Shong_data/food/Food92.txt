Brewer’s mixed fruit beverage debuts in Malaysia
Malaysians were the first in Asia to enjoy Somersby Cider’s first combination flavour – Somersby Passion Fruit & Orange Cider.

Available in 320ml cans, this tropical fruit variant combines sweet oranges and tangy passion fruit in a refreshing cider to complement the existing Somersby Cider variants of apple, blackberry and watermelon.

The tropical quencher made its debut here in March.

“Somersby Cider has been the best-selling cider in Malaysia since its launch a decade ago,” said Carlsberg Malaysia marketing director Caroline Moreau.

“Our bold innovative flavours have constantly excited and captivated cider consumers.

“This is the first time we are combining two different fruits, passion fruit and orange, made with only the finest quality ingredients,” she added.

The 4.5% ABV Somersby Passion Fruit & Orange Cider is best served chilled over ice.

The alcoholic beverage can be savoured on its own or as a complement to food.
