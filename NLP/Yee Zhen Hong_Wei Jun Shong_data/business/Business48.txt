Market expected to stage ‘oversold bounce’ this week
KUALA LUMPUR: Bursa Malaysia is expected to see a rebound on bargain hunting this week as traders return to grab both higher and lower liners.

Fund manager Nazri Khan Adam Khan said the expected “oversold bounce” is in response to the steep correction seen in the past three months.

Nazri, who is also executive director at Inter-Pacific Asset Management Sdn Bhd, expects the benchmark FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI (FBM KLCI) to move within the 1,450 and 1,480 range.

“I will call this an ‘oversold bounce’ because the index has been oversold for the last three months. The market was down for 10 out of 12 weeks. That is considered extremely oversold,” he told Bernama.

Nonetheless, the broader market managed to outperform its regional peers. “This means our correction is lower as our economic data is still resilient. Consumer spending is still strong,” he said.

Nazri reckons that Bursa Malaysia would continue its uptrend on the back of the rise in the commodities sector.

“We are relatively better in terms of economic data, sentiment and the movement of the FBM KLCI because we are driven by commodity stocks that cushion our broad stock market, especially (those related to) oil,” he said.

He added that there are plenty of opportunities as the stocks are seen to be cheaper and the dividends higher, coupled with much support to cushion against a big crash although the market is likely to see a downtrend in the medium term.

Last week, the local bourse was traded mixed, pressured by heavy selling and cautious investor sentiment on concerns over inflation even as market sentiment improved across the region.

Last Friday, the FBM KLCI rose 5.65 points, or 0.39%, to 1,436.70 from Thursday’s close of 1,431.05.

On a weekly basis, the benchmark index lost 20.04 points.
