Bursa tumbles to lowest level in 25 months
KUALA LUMPUR: The FBM KLCI lost 26.78 points to close at its lowest level in 25 months at the end of the trading day today.

Dealers attributed the drop to heavy selling of plantation, energy and healthcare stocks on Bursa Malaysia on global recession and interest rates worries.

The key index ended the day at 1,431.10, which was 1.83% down from yesterday’s close of 1,457.88.

This is the weakest level seen on the local exchange since May 20, 2020 when it closed at 1,435.12.

The market opened 3.25 points firmer at 1,461.13 and hit a high of 1,461.53 in early trading before sliding down to its intra-day low of 1,431.10 at the close.

On the broader market, decliners thumped gainers 640 to 255, while 381 counters were unchanged, 999 untraded, and 19 others suspended.

Total turnover decreased to 2.72 billion units worth RM1.9 billion from 2.79 billion units worth RM1.86 billion yesterday.

Rakuten Trade Sdn Bhd vice-president of equity research Thong Pak Leng said the decline on the local bourse was in tandem with that of regional peers which also closed broadly lower as investors were cautious ahead of US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s key testimony before Congress later, which is expected to be extremely hawkish.

“Additionally, there are worries that an economic downturn in the US could spread to other regions around the world,” Thong told Bernama.

The direction of the local bourse in the near term remains uncertain and would depend very much on regional volatility, he added.

“Nonetheless, at the current level, we believe the FBM KLCI remains in an oversold position, hence we expect the benchmark index to stage a rebound soon,” he said.

Thong anticipates the local bourse to move higher within the range of 1,430-1,460 for the remainder of the week, with immediate resistance at 1,490 and support at 1,415.
