Duopharma has set its sights on expansion via multiple avenues
PETALING JAYA: Duopharma Biotech Bhd is looking into multiple avenues for expansion including mergers and acquisitions, according to its managing director, Leonard Ariff Abdul.

He elaborated that the group has identified and evaluated a number of local and international companies to ascertain whether they meet internal criteria.

“The management will continue to evaluate some of these targets and will work towards finalising their plans in 2022,” Leonard said in a statement following its annual general meeting.

In addition, Duopharma also aims to strengthen its environmental, social and governance (ESG) platform to intensify global focus on sustainability.

To this end it has committed to the target of achieving carbon neutrality by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2050.

The group has initiated a greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting and management process aimed to reduce its emissions.

Last year, it embarked on the development of a five-year ESG Strategy (2022-2026), and announced its environmental pledge in conjunction with its roadmap in March 2022. These initiatives will commence this year onwards.

Leonard stated that Duopharma will put a greater focus on digitising the group.

“As part of the efforts, a digital health strategy has been crafted to identify opportunities that will allow the group to provide the best solutions along the healthcare value chain,” he said in a statement.

On this front, the group will build on its investment in Naluri Hidup Sdn Bhd. Through a collaboration, the two offer an app for cancer and kidney patients to manage their treatments simultaneously getting emotional support from qualified therapists.
