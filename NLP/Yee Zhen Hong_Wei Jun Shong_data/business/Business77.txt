Malaysia’s productivity up 1.8%, signalling positive economic growth
KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia’s productivity growth rebounded to 1.8% after registering negative growth or -5.3% in 2020.

The productivity output per person registered RM90,697 in 2021, compared to RM89,106 per person in 2020, signalling an awakening from the slow economic bumps due to the impact of the pandemic, even though the country had yet to return to its pre-pandemic productivity performance then.

The overall growth of sub sectors under the nine Productivity Nexus had rebounded to the average of 3.3% in 2021 from -5.1% in 2020, said deputy minister, international trade and industry, Lim Ban Hong.

He added that all the sub-sectors registered a positive growth except for retail and food & beverages, tourism, and professional services.

“The electrical and electronics (E&E) sub-sector registered the highest annual productivity growth of 12% due to the increasing global demand for E&E components,” he said in his opening remarks at the Malaysia Productivity Corporation’s (MPC) Productivity Conference themed “Driving Productivity of the Nation” today.

Lim noted that the chemicals and chemical products, and machinery and equipment sub-sectors recorded a tremendous increase in productivity growth at 10.3% and 9.0%, respectively.
