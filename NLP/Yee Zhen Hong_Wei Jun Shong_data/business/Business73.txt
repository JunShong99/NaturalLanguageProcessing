Bargain hunting drives Bursa higher
KUALA LUMPUR: Bursa Malaysia ended at its intraday high on Tuesday due to improved market sentiment across the region, as buying support emerged primarily in healthcare, technology, and energy stocks, a dealer said.

The barometer index rose 16.64 points, or 1.15%, to 1,457.88 from Monday’s close of 1,441.24.

After opening 2.06 points higher at 1,443.30, the market bellwether hit a low of 1,443.26 in the morning session.

On the broader market, gainers outnumbered decliners 684 to 308, while 333 counters were unchanged, 950 untraded, and 19 others suspended.

Total turnover increased to 2.79 billion units worth RM1.86 billion from 2.62 billion units worth RM1.69 billion on Monday.

Rakuten Trade Sdn Bhd vice-president of equity research Thong Pak Leng said key regional indices were higher as the upbeat performance of Wall Street futures lifted the overall market sentiment.

He said investors also took the opportunity to bargain hunt for cheaper stocks following the recent selloffs.

“As for the local bourse, we are cautiously optimistic given the improvement in regional market sentiments, nonetheless, investors will stay cautious due to the increasing market volatility,” he told Bernama.

Thong expects the benchmark index to trend sideways with an uptrend bias within the range of 1,440-1,465 for the remainder of the week.

“On a technical point of view, we shall see immediate resistance at 1,490 and support at 1,435,” he said.

Bursa Malaysia heavyweight Maybank was unchanged at RM8.65, IHH Healthcare added 16 sen to RM6.49, Hartalega was 12 sen better at RM2.94, Top Glove gained 9.5 sen to RM1.08, Dialog Group expanded seven sen to RM2.10, and Inari Amertron perked up five sen to RM2.65.
