RM1.2bil Kampung Baru project gets the go ahead
KUALA LUMPUR: The RM1.2 billion redevelopment project in Kampung Baru will proceed now that majority of the local residents have given their approval.

The Jalan Tun Razak PKNS Flat project will be undertaken by Menara Rezeki Properties Sdn Bhd, a join venture company of Menara Rezeki Sdn Bhd (MRSB) and Jiankun International Bhd.

In a statement issued today, MRSB said it will be submitting a proposal pertaining to the redevelopment project to the local government soon.

Early this year, the developer held a closed-door meeting with the residents and the PKNS Flat Action Committee, Kampung Baru to present the proposal for the redevelopment project.

MRSB managing director Saiful Nizam Yusoff said the company took into consideration the needs and problems of existing landowners and had devised a detailed plan.

“With the capabilities of MRSB and its partners, I am very excited to see this redevelopment project becoming a reality four years from now,” he said.

The proposed redevelopment plan entails a 52-storey apartment tower, built for the existing owners of the PKNS flats, as well as three additional towers comprising residential and retail units.
