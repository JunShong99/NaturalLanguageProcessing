Bursa stays in the red at the midday break
KUALA LUMPUR: Bursa Malaysia continued to stay in the red across the board at midday as the overall market sentiment remained weak, weighed by profit-taking in selected heavyweight stocks, a dealer said.

At the lunch break, the FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI (FBM KLCI) declined by 10.72 points to 1,447.16 from Tuesday’s close of 1,457.88.

The benchmark index, which opened 3.25 points firmer at 1,461.13, moved between 1,445.39 and 1,461.53 throughout the session.

On the broader market, decliners led gainers 489 to 276, while 313 counters were unchanged, 1,197 untraded and 19 others suspended. Turnover stood at 1.52 billion units worth RM775.13 million.

However, ActivTrades trader Anderson Alves sees Asian equities steadying today as there have been signs that a broad risk-on mood has returned to the markets following recent declines. “Outlining this sentiment was a fall in the S&P 500 volatility index,” he said.

The market will likely see further support from the month’s and end-of-quarter trade, with traders expecting a rise in demand for global stocks as June draws to a close, he added.

Rakuten Trade vice-president of equity research Thong Pak Leng told Bernama that the index is expected to trend between the 1,450 and 1,470 range today following the strong rally overnight on Wall St.

Among the heavyweight stocks, Maybank and Public Bank dipped two sen to RM8.63 and RM4.45, respectively, IHH Healthcare lost nine sen to RM6.40, CIMB shed six sen to RM4.90, while Petronas Chemicals added three sen to RM9.53 and TNB was flat at RM8.18.

Of the actives, MNC Wireless was up by half-a-sen to two sen, Lay Hong gained 4.5 sen to 31.5 sen, Cypark Resources rose four sen to 45.5 sen, while TWL Holdings eased half-a-point to seven sen and Top Glove slid three sen to RM1.05.
