Banking system remains well capitalised to support recovery, says BNM
KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia’s banking system remains well capitalised to support economic recovery, said Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM).

The central bank said capital ratios rose marginally in May, driven by valuation gains on available-for-sale financial instruments as bond yields eased temporarily during the period.

“As at end-May 2022, the banking system recorded RM121.5 billion excess capital buffers,” said BNM in its monthly highlights for its May 2022 report released today.

The central bank said overall gross and net impaired loans ratios remained broadly stable at 1.6% and 1% respectively, reflecting the marginal increase in impairments from the business and household segments following the tapering of repayment assistance measures since the first quarter of 2022.

“Total provisions remained at a prudent level, accounting for 1.8% of total banking system loans and 109.1% of impaired loans.

“As of end-May 2022, total provisions and regulatory reserves stood at RM40.7 billion (end-April: RM40.2 billion),” it added.

On the domestic financial market, BNM said market adjustments remained orderly, following the decrease in the 10-year Malaysian Government Securities yield by 21 basis points (bps) during the month, supported by foreign portfolio inflows into the domestic bond market.

By contrast, regional bond yields rose by 24.5 bps on average, it said.

The central bank said the local financial market was also driven by tighter global financial conditions due to expectations for faster and larger policy rate hikes by advanced economies, especially the US, amid higher and more prolonged inflationary pressures.
