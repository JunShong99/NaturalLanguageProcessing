Bursa Malaysia extends gains to close higher
KUALA LUMPUR: Bursa Malaysia extended yesterday's gains to end higher today, supported by buying demand in selected industrial products and media as well as telecommunications and services counters amid cautious sentiment on regional bourses, dealers said.

Press Metal and Telekom Malaysia were the top two gainers, putting on 14.0 sen to RM5.44 and 26.0 sen to RM4.97, respectively, and contributed a total of 3.68 points to the gains in the FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI (FBM KLCI).

At 5 pm, the benchmark index rose 5.59 points, or 0.36 per cent, to 1,541.15 from Wednesday’s close of 1,535.56, after moving between 1,535.89 and 1,541.75 throughout the day.

The FBM KLCI opened 4.16 points higher at 1,539.72.
However, market breadth was negative with decliners outpacing advancers 557 to 406, while 364 counters were unchanged, 986 untraded, and 31 others suspended.

Total turnover rose to 2.89 billion units worth RM1.92 billion from 2.34 billion units worth RM1.80 billion on Wednesday.

Rakuten Trade Sdn Bhd vice-president of equity research Thong Pak Leng said the FBM KLCI moved higher as investors continued to bargain hunt for stocks at reduced levels after the recent heavy selldown.
"Regionally, the key indices closed mixed as investors remained wary of the economic impact of China’s ongoing COVID-19 lockdowns. Meanwhile, the Bank of Korea’s announcement of a 25-basis points increase in its base rate to 1.75 per cent would add some pressure on equities valuations.

"As for the local bourse, we believe the market is oversold (earlier), however, we advise investors to stay alert on the increasing market volatility and external uncertainties. We anticipate the benchmark index to remain sideways within the range of 1,535-1,545 towards the weekend, with immediate support at 1,520 and resistance at 1,560,” he told Bernama today.
