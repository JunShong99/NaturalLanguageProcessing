Ringgit gets a boost from expectation of better CPI
KUALA LUMPUR: An expected rise in the consumer price index (CPI) helped the ringgit open marginally higher against the US dollar today.

At 9am, the local currency was trading at 4.4020/4.4050 against the greenback from yesterday’s close of 4.4045/4.4075.

Bank Islam Malaysia Bhd chief economist Mohd Afzanizam Abdul Rashid said the CPI for May 2022 is expected to be higher at 3%, a sign that further normalisation of the monetary policy is quite likely.

“In that sense, the local note would be supported as the prospect of a higher overnight policy rate would help to keep the interest rate differential with the US rate at a decent level,” he told Bernama.

The Department of Statistics Malaysia is scheduled to release the CPI report for May later in the day.

Meanwhile, Afzanizam said fears of a recession will continue to drive the prevailing sentiment.

“Therefore, demand for safe-haven currencies such as the US dollar will remain intact,” he added.

Meanwhile, the ringgit was trading mixed against a basket of major currencies.

The local note strengthened versus the Singapore dollar to 3.1653/3.1679 from yesterday’s close of 3.1682/3.1706 and rose against the euro to 4.6283/4.6314 from 4.6318/4.6349 previously.

However, it depreciated vis-a-vis the Japanese yen to 3.2583/3.2608 from 3.2534/3.2559 and weakened against the British pound to 5.3907/5.3944 from 5.3722/5.3758 yesterday.
