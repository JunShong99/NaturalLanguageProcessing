Malaysia’s PPI continues to record high growth
KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia’s producer price index (PPI) local production, which measures the costs of goods at the factory gate, remained high in May with a growth of 11.2% year-on-year (y-o-y) compared with 11% y-o-y in April 2022, said the statistics department (DoSM).

Chief Statistician Uzir Mahidin attributed the growth to the mining index, which increased 20.6% y-o-y against 18.4% y-o-y in April 2022.

He said the agriculture, forestry and fishing index grew by 16.7% y-o-y, mainly led by an increase in the indices of perennial crops (21.2%), fishing (11.3%) and non-perennial crops (7.8%).

The manufacturing index registered a double-digit increase of 10.1% for the first time since August 2011, underpinned by an increase in indices of subsectors, namely the manufacture of vegetable and animal oils and fats (24.5%), manufacture of refined petroleum products (22.9%) and the manufacture of basic chemicals, among others.

“In addition, the indices of water supply increased 1.2%, while electricity and gas supply decreased 0.6%,” he said in a statement today.

On a month-on-month basis, Uzir said the PPI local production increased 1.2% versus 0.2% recorded in the previous month.
