All states record positive growth, five states outperform national growth rate
PUTRAJAYA: The economic performance of all states recorded a positive growth in 2021, with five states outperforming the national growth rate of 3.1%.

Department of Statistics Malaysia (DoSM) chief statistician Uzir Mahidin said the five performing states were Penang with a growth rate of 6.8%, followed by Selangor, recording 5%, Terengganu, 3.6%, Perak, 3.5%, and Kedah, 3.2%.

“The main drivers of the gross domestic product (GDP) performance were the manufacturing and services sectors,” Uzir said in a statement.

He added that 13 states and two federal territories registered an increase in the GDP per capita value compared to 2020, with seven states recording above the national level of RM47,324.

These states were the Federal Territory (FT) of Kuala Lumpur, registering GDP per capita of RM124,232 and FT of Labuan, RM78,032, Penang RM58,527, and Sarawak RM57,635.

Meanwhile, Selangor recorded GDP per capita of RM55,568, Melaka recorded RM47,799 and Negeri Sembilan, RM47,452.

Uzir expects the reopening of the nation’s borders, implementation of aid and economic stimulus packages, as well as the success of the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme to continue to drive growth in the economy.

He said the recovery impact was seen in the improved GDP growth rate of 5% in the first quarter of 2022 compared with a contraction of 0.5% in Q1 2021.
