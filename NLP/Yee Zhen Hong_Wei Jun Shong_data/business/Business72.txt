Astro Q1 profit falls 29%
PETALING JAYA: Astro Malaysia Holdings Bhd posted a net profit of RM100.02 million for the first quarter ended April 30, 2022, a 29.2% fall from RM141.25 million reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous year on higher financing costs.

Revenue stood at RM962.09 million, a 9.4% decrease from RM1.061 billion reported previously.

In a stock exchange filing, it expressed cautious optimism for the financial year despite Malaysia’s transition into the endemic phase and expectation of economic recovery.

Astro said the recovery is expected to be uneven with headwinds from intermittent Covid-19 waves, supply chain disruption leading to cost-push inflation, further interest rate hikes, and near term market volatility resulting from current geopolitical events.

Its group chief executive officer Henry Tan said the group has remained steadfast in executing its transformation plan and streaming aggregation strategy despite the headwinds.

“Our average revenue per user improved to RM97.40, as customers migrated to the new and better value packages we launched last November,” he said in a statement. “We are committed to further enhance the all-new Astro experience, in realising our vision to be the entertainment destination for Malaysians.”

For the quarter, its board has declared a first interim single tier dividend of 1.25 sen per share amounting to RM65.18 million to be paid on July 20, 2022.

Astro also announced its independent non-executive director, Tunku Ali Redhauddin Ibni Tuanku Muhriz will succeed its current chairman, Zaki Azmi, upon his retirement after its annual general meeting on June 23, 2022.
