Air passenger traffic takes off with return of more carriers
KUALA LUMPUR: Six more foreign carriers are flying into Malaysian airports again, giving international passenger traffic a major boost.

In a statement issued today, Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd (MAHB) said 1.03 million international passenger movements were recorded in May, breaching the one-million mark for the first time since March 2020 when borders were closed to curb the spread of Covid-19.

Among the six carriers, five are resuming flights to Malaysia, while the sixth is a new carrier, landing in Malaysia for the first time.

Among the five airlines that have returned to Malaysian airspace are India’s low-cost carrier IndiGo, which flies from Chennai and Tiruchirappalli to Kuala Lumpur and Thai Smile Airways on the Bangkok-Penang route.

Across the South China Sea, Royal Brunei Airlines has resumed flights from Bandar Seri Begawan to Kuching and Kota Kinabalu while South Korea’s Jin Air has reinstated its Incheon-Kota Kinabalu route, and Philippines AirAsia is flying the Manila-Kota Kinabalu route again.

Apart from that Lanmei Airlines, Cambodia’s low-cost carrier, has begun weekly flights from Phnom Penh to Kuala Lumpur on an Airbus A320.

“It is the third airline, after Malaysia Airlines and AirAsia, to serve this route,” MAHB said.

MAHB managing director Iskandar Mizal Mahmood said the airport operator has recorded a monthly rise in international passenger traffic exceeding 50% since borders reopened two months ago.

“The demand is there for airlines to seize the opportunity and speed up recovery. For an airport operator, every new foreign airline entering the country signals growth for the aviation landscape,” he said.

Lanmei Airlines is the second new foreign carrier MAHB has welcomed into the country this year, bringing the number of foreign airlines operating in Malaysia to 43.
